# Ollama Setup Guide for MindfulCare

## If Llama3 Doesn't Work

The reasons Llama3 isn't working is **memory requirements**:

- **Llama3 (full model)**: Requires ~5.4 GB RAM
- **Your system**: Has ~4.1 GB available RAM
- **Result**: Model can't load due to insufficient memory

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Built-in Support (Recommended)
The chatbot now has comprehensive built-in responses for:
- ✅ Self-care plans and strategies
- ✅ Anxiety and stress management
- ✅ Depression support
- ✅ Sleep issues
- ✅ Panic attacks
- ✅ Loneliness
- ✅ Grief and loss

**No setup required** - just use the chatbot as is!


## How the System Works Now

1. **Built-in Support**: Always available with specialized mental health responses
2. **Enhanced AI**: Optional - uses Ollama when available and memory permits
3. **Graceful Fallback**: Automatically switches to built-in responses if AI fails

## Testing the Chatbot

Try these requests to see the built-in system in action:
- "I need a 5 day self care plan"
- "I'm feeling anxious"
- "I can't sleep"
- "I feel lonely"
- "I'm grieving"

The chatbot will provide detailed, helpful responses even without Ollama running!
